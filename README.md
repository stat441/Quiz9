# Quiz9

As discussed in class, our second project will coincide with the scheduled final exam on Wednesday May 11th. I'll provide a complete rubric for project 2 next week, but here are some things to consider.

- The project will require a written report and a short verbal presentation.
- Groups of up to size 3 will be permitted.
- The project should include a blocking factor and at least 2 different treatment factors.
- The project will be scaffolded with upcoming quizes and homework assignments

## Questions:

1. Do you plan to work in a group? If so, who will you be working with?
2. Propose a project. Define your research goal, EUs, treatment factors, and blocking factors.
